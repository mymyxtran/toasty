Inspiration
With so much of our lives online, it's more important than ever to be able to stay focused and motivated, especially for students. The Pomodoro technique is something we found personally useful as a productivity tool, and so we wanted to create one with calm and cozy vibes (just in time for the holiday season!).

What it does
It has a count down timer for alternating 25 minute work sessions and 5 minute breaks, counting the number of work sessions. The website also provides a soothing seasonal instrumental playlist for you to listen to as you work, as well as an interactive To Do list to help you stay on task.

How we built it
We built this primarily with the Bulma framework, HTML and JavaScript.

Challenges we ran into
A major challenge I had was getting the timer and buttons to function properly, and linking/communicating between the HTML and JavaScript files.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I don't have a lot of experience with web development, and so I'm really proud of how this turned out. Aesthetically, it looks wonderful, and the fireplace animation and Tunes section really calm me. I think we created a fun experience that I personally am excited to continue to use.

What I learned
I learned a lot more about how JavaScript works, how to deal with interactivity, as well as the importance of linking the HTML and JavaScript files. I got a deeper understanding of how the different languages interact with each other, as well as more about JavaScript syntax.

What's next for Toasty Timer
I think we could add a few more features, but I'm honestly quite satisfied with how it is now!
