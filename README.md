Inspiration
With so much of our lives online, it's more important than ever to be able to stay focused and motivated, especially for students. The Pomodoro technique is something we found personally useful as a productivity tool, and so we wanted to create one with calm and cozy vibes (just in time for the holiday season!).

What it does
It has a count down timer for alternating 25 minute work sessions and 5 minute breaks, counting the number of work sessions. The website also provides a soothing seasonal instrumental playlist for you to listen to as you work, as well as an interactive To Do list to help you stay on task.

How we built it
We built this primarily with the Bulma framework, HTML and JavaScript.
